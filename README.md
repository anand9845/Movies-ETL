Some time we get data in very bad condition. So it is the best idea to convert data in such a way that we can use them later. In preprocessing we can use different steps:
. Removing Duplicates
. Normalizing Values
. Removing/Filling Null Values
. Balancing Data

It is a good practice to preprocess data. Because later it saves some space  and we make better use of it rather than raw data
